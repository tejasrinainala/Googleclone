* This repository shows my website that i created a clone for Google.
* For creating this, i used html and css languages
* It is a beginner project for someone who is learning web development like me.
* In html,i used different tags like img,body,input,button,etc... for creating several components in y website
* In css,i used different properties like height,width,margins,padding,flexbox,etc... to style the components used in the website.
* Thats how Google clone was created by me.
